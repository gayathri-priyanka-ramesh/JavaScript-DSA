/* Searching Algorithm: Locating a specific element or item within a collection of data
                        Efficiently navigate through data structures to find the desired information
                        Primary Objective - Determine whether the desired element exists within the data, and if so, to identify its precise location or retrieve it
                        Used in computational tasks and real-world applications, including information retrieval, data analysis, decision-making processes

        Terminologies:
            Target Element            -> Item (a value, a record, a key, or any other data entity of interest) to find within the data collection

            Search Space              -> Entire collection of data within which the target element is looked for
                                         Depending on the data structure used, the search space may vary in size and organization.

            Complexity                -> Have different levels of complexity depending on the data structure and the algorithm used
                                         It is measured in terms of time and space requirements.

            Deterministic Search      -> Follow a clear, systematic approach
                                         Example: Binary Search 

            Non-deterministic Search -> May need to examine the entire search space in the worst case
                                        Example: Linear Search
